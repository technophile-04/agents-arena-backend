# agents-arena-backend

Backend for BuidlGuidl's **Agents Arena** — two coding agents race to solve the on-chain AI CTF, live, each in its own Docker container. One `codex` entrant and one `opencode` entrant. Every step streams to the frontend over server-sent events. Scores come from on-chain `FlagMinted` events, not an off-chain answer key.

Backend only — the frontend lives in a separate ai-ctf fork. This repo ships a small mock React frontend so the backend team can exercise the full slice (SSE → browser) on its own.

## Status

Working today:
- Two real agents (`codex` + `opencode`) boot in isolated, hardened containers, run bash / `forge` / `cast`, reach the chain, and stream normalized events.
- One replayable SSE feed per run. A reconnect replays from `Last-Event-ID` with no gap and no duplicate.
- A mock React frontend renders two lanes and a run log.
- Burner wallet + funding gate, proven against the local chain by a drill. Exactly-once scoring, tested against a local node.

Not wired yet:
- The on-chain register → mint → score path is not connected into the run lifecycle. The agents run and stream; a full run does not yet register an identity or mint flags. That is the next pass.

## How it works

One process owns a run: lifecycle, containers, credentials, the event journal, and score state. It holds an open Docker socket and a SQLite file. No queue, no websockets, no Kubernetes.

- **Entrant** — a coding-agent CLI + model + funded wallet, running in its own container as one long-lived, steerable session.
- **Ready barrier** — both entrants prepare and hold. The run releases them together on one recorded start time, so boot time never decides the race.
- **Steer** — an operator injects a free-text turn into a live agent mid-race. An idle agent that still has flags to win is auto-nudged from on-chain truth. Both use one injection path.
- **Journal** — every fact is one append-only row with a global `id` and a per-source `seq`. The feed is a projection; a reconnect replays it.
- **Chain profile** — moves the arena between the local chain and Base by changing only addresses, RPC, and confirmation depth.

Transport is each CLI's line-JSON stdout (`codex --json`, `opencode --format json`), normalized into one `ArenaEvent` stream. SSE, not websockets — `Last-Event-ID` replay is native and the traffic is asymmetric (a steer is a plain POST).

## Stack

TypeScript on Node, one pnpm workspace, `tsx` (no build step), vitest. Fastify (HTTP + SSE), drizzle-orm + better-sqlite3 (the journal), viem (chain watch + funding), dockerode (containers). Mock frontend: Vite + React + TanStack Query + native EventSource. One pinned Docker image carries Foundry, the `codex` and `opencode` CLIs, and the in-container runner.

## Run it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r typecheck && pnpm -r test
```

Start the dev chain — the ai-ctf repo's own local Scaffold-ETH node:

```bash
# in the ai-ctf repo
yarn chain        # hardhat node on :8545
yarn deploy       # 12 challenges + NFTFlags + registry
```

Build the entrant image and run the backend:

```bash
docker/build.sh                                # -> arena-entrant:dev
ARENA_DB=:memory: pnpm --filter backend dev    # Fastify on :4177
```

Create a run and watch the feed:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4177/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"preset":"docker-duel","autoStart":true}'

curl -N http://127.0.0.1:4177/runs/<id>/events # SSE
```

Smoke one real agent, or the funding gate, without a full run:

```bash
# one real turn in a container: forge --version, cast chain-id, summarize
tsx packages/backend/scripts/demo-entrant.ts codex
tsx packages/backend/scripts/demo-entrant.ts opencode

# funding drill — two terminals
tsx packages/backend/scripts/demo-funding.ts 0.05   # creates + watches burners
packages/backend/scripts/fund-drill.sh              # funds them; gate passes
```

Credentials come from the host: `codex` reads `~/.codex/auth.json`, `opencode` reads `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (or its `auth.json`). Nothing is committed. For a ChatGPT-account `codex` login, leave the model as `default` — API-only model ids are rejected.

## What happens on start

`POST /runs/:id/start`:

1. Prepare each entrant — build a fresh container, seed its credentials, run preflight (`forge`, `cast`, the CLI version).
2. Hold at the ready barrier until both report ready.
3. Record one start time and release both with their opening prompt.
4. Parse each agent's stdout into `ArenaEvent`s, append them to the journal, and stream them to the browser.

If either preflight fails, the run fails and both containers are torn down. Neither starts.

## API

| method | path | role |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/runs` | create from a preset; accepts `autoStart` and `idempotencyKey` |
| POST | `/runs/:id/start` | release a prepared run through the ready barrier |
| POST | `/runs/:id/stop` | stop and tear down |
| POST | `/runs/:id/entrants/:eid/steer` | inject a turn into one live agent |
| GET | `/runs/:id` | snapshot: state, entrants, addresses, scores, last event id |
| GET | `/runs/:id/events` | replayable SSE feed |

Control endpoints are operator-only for v1. The API contract travels as checked-in files (`contract/API.md` + `contract/arena-types.ts`); the frontend fork copies the types.
