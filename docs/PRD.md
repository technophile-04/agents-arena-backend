# Agents Arena v1 backend — PRD

frozen from the design session on 2026-07-22. locked decisions are the ADRs 0001-0008 in `docs/adr/decisions-log.md`; vocabulary is in glossary.md. this PRD defines the vertical slices. it covers the **backend only** — damu and pablo own the real frontend in their ai-ctf fork.

## goal

one authoritative backend that runs a live race: one Codex entrant and one OpenCode entrant (Claude Code deferred, ADR-0008), in isolated Docker containers, solving the real ai-ctf repo on Base. Austin Griffith gets one action to start it and can steer either agent mid-race. the browser sees a normalized, replayable event feed; the leaderboard is on-chain `FlagMinted` truth.

## success bars

1. a codex-vs-opencode run survives a browser reconnect and a backend restart without losing timeline or double-counting a flag.
2. Austin starts the race with one action; both entrants are released from the same ready barrier, so boot time never decides the race.
3. Austin can inject a free-text steer into either entrant while it runs, and the arena auto-nudges an idle entrant that still has flags to win.
4. every mint is scored from chain events, mapped to the right entrant wallet, exactly once.
5. the whole vertical slice is demoable in a mock frontend against the ai-ctf local chain — no live ETH until the rehearsal slice.

## locked decisions (see ADRs)

- **separate repo** `agents-arena-backend`, its own mock React frontend for demos (ADR-0001).
- **API contract as checked-in files** (`contract/API.md` + `contract/arena-types.ts`), copied by the frontend fork (ADR-0002).
- **entrant = persistent steerable session**, not a one-shot process; Austin-steer and auto-nudge are one injection path (ADR-0003).
- **transport = stdout JSON**; hooks deferred (ADR-0004).
- **fresh wallet per entrant per run**, held in `awaiting_funding` behind a balance-watch gate; Austin funds live, or an operator key auto-funds in rehearsal (ADR-0005).
- **agent self-registers its ERC-8004 identity**; the backend never writes to a registry (ADR-0006).
- **dev substrate = ai-ctf local chain via a chain profile**; real Base only at rehearsal (ADR-0007).

## stack

TypeScript on Node, Fastify (HTTP + SSE), `dockerode` (containers), `viem` (chain watch + funding), SQLite (journal + snapshots), `codex` and `opencode` pinned CLIs inside one pinned image with Foundry. toolchain: pnpm workspaces, `tsx` runtime (no build step), `vitest`. no Redis, NATS, Kubernetes, or worker queue. mock frontend: minimal React (Vite), deliberately ugly.

## run lifecycle

`created → preparing → awaiting_funding → ready → running → stopping → finished` (or `failed`). the run manager is the only writer of this state; on restart it reconciles SQLite against containers carrying `runId`/`entrantId` Docker labels.

## backend modules (the seams)

- **run manager** — owns lifecycle, readiness, one start time, stop, restart reconciliation.
- **entrant runtime** (`arena-runner`, container PID 1 via `--init`) — creates the container, seeds wallet + private credential home, runs preflight, holds behind the barrier, owns the persistent session, injects turns, forwards stdout, tears down.
- **harness adapter** — per-CLI: command, credential home, preflight, stdout parser, mapping to `ArenaEvent`, turn injection. Codex and OpenCode in v1; Claude later behind the same seam (ADR-0008).
- **event journal** — SQLite, append-only, global `id`, per-source `seq`, one run-level SSE stream, `Last-Event-ID` replay, Docker-log dedup on restart.
- **game-state adapter** — `viem` watches `FlagMinted`, maps wallet → entrant, projects score events (unique on `(runId, entrantAddress, challengeId)`, two confirmations), `Ponder` for reconciliation.
- **wallet/funding** — generates keypair, watches balance to cross the funding gate, sweeps optional.

## endpoints (contract)

| endpoint | use |
|---|---|
| `POST /runs` | create from a preset, begin preparation; accepts `autoStart` and an idempotency key |
| `POST /runs/:id/start` | release a fully-ready run to `running` |
| `POST /runs/:id/stop` | stop and clean up |
| `POST /runs/:id/entrants/:eid/steer` | inject an Austin steer turn into one entrant (or a run-level variant for both) |
| `GET /runs/:id` | snapshot: state, entrants, addresses, scores, last event id |
| `GET /runs/:id/events` | replayable SSE feed for the whole run |

control endpoints are operator-only; snapshot + events can be spectator-readable, but stay private for v1 (the backend owns the Docker socket).

## vertical slices

each slice ends demoable in the mock frontend against the ai-ctf local chain. thin and independently verifiable, so the team can parallelize where deps allow.

### slice 1 — skeleton: API + journal + SSE
Fastify server, SQLite journal, `POST /runs` (fake preset), `GET /runs/:id`, `GET /runs/:id/events` SSE. a fake event source emits sample `ArenaEvent`s. mock frontend renders two lanes + a live log.
**done:** browser shows streamed fake events; reconnect replays from `Last-Event-ID`; `contract/arena-types.ts` + `contract/API.md` exist and the frontend imports the types.

### slice 2 — one real Codex entrant in a container
pinned Docker image (codex + opencode CLIs + Foundry + Node + `arena-runner`). Codex adapter: `CODEX_HOME=… codex exec --json --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` (no `--ephemeral` — resume needs the session; steer = `codex exec resume <thread_id>`), private `CODEX_HOME` seeded from host auth. run manager brings up one container, streams normalized events to the journal.
**done:** a real Codex session runs a harmless task (read a file, `forge --version`, `cast chain-id` against local chain) in a clean container; its structured activity appears in the mock frontend; cleanup removes the container + credential copy.

### slice 3 — one real OpenCode entrant
OpenCode adapter: `opencode run --format json --auto -m <preset model>`, OpenRouter key via env; steer = `opencode run -s <sessionID>`. same preflight rehearsal, same normalized events.
**done:** OpenCode passes the same harmless rehearsal and streams normalized events; both adapters emit the same `ArenaEvent` shape.

### slice 4 — ready barrier + two lanes
`POST /runs` with `autoStart` prepares both, holds in `ready` until both report READY, records one start time, releases together. persistent sessions stay open for injection.
**done:** one action starts both; if either preflight fails, neither starts; two lanes stream side by side from one SSE connection.

### slice 5 — wallets + funding gate
generate a keypair per entrant, hold in `awaiting_funding`, watch balance on the local chain, proceed when both cross the threshold. dashboard shows both addresses. operator-key auto-fund for rehearsal; manual send path for the live moment.
**done:** a run pauses on addresses, funds (auto in dev), then advances to ready; preflight confirms funded + flag-#1-not-minted.

### slice 6 — FlagMinted watcher → scores
game-state adapter watches `FlagMinted` on the chain profile, maps wallet → entrant, projects score events idempotently (two confirmations, dedup on `(runId, entrantAddress, challengeId)`). agent runs the real CTF prompt and mints flag #1.
**done:** an entrant registers its ERC-8004 identity, calls `Challenge1.registerAgent`, and the score appears once in the feed; a replay/reconnect never double-counts.

### slice 7 — steer + auto-nudge
`POST /runs/:id/entrants/:eid/steer` appends an Austin turn to a live session. auto-nudge fires when an entrant goes idle (stdout turn-end) with flags < 12 and time remaining, built from on-chain flag truth. both emit `entrant.steered` / `entrant.nudged` events.
**done:** Austin's typed steer reaches a running agent and changes its behavior; an idle agent gets auto-nudged and resumes; both show in the feed.

### slice 8 — recovery + real-Base rehearsal
restart the backend mid-run, rebuild missed events from Docker logs, reconcile scores against Ponder. then flip the chain profile to real Base and run one paired race end to end.
**done:** success bar 1 holds under a real restart; one codex-vs-opencode race completes against real Base with correct scoring and full cleanup.

## out of scope for v1

frontend polish (damu + pablo), Claude Code in the race (subscription ban risk, ADR-0008; adapter seam reserved), agent chat / `arena say`, a literal interactive terminal, more than two entrants, public spectator scale, managed sandboxes / microVMs, hooks (deferred to a later iteration, headline use = tx-interception).

## open questions (parked — don't block the build)

- prod runner host: the long-lived machine that owns the backend, Docker Engine, and reverse proxy.
- which BuidlGuidl Claude + ChatGPT subscription tiers / org credentials for the public event, and the terms fit for headless subscription use.
- how much Base ETH per entrant and safe replenishment for the live event.
- exact model, effort, system prompt, tool policy per harness (rehearsed, not guessed).
- first OpenCode provider/model.
- live event: accept the ai-ctf shared-state interference (challenges 5/8/11) as part of the race, or deploy a clean competition instance.
- naming — `agents-arena-backend` is a working name.

## first build target

slices 1-4 are the spine (API → containers → both harnesses → barrier). build order: slice 1 solo (unblocks the contract), then slices 2 and 3 in parallel (independent adapters), then slice 4 integrates. slices 5-8 follow the chain-and-race path.
