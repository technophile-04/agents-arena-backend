# agent-arena ADR log

hard-to-reverse decisions from the design session, 2026-07-22. one entry per decision that is costly to change, surprising without context, and the result of a real trade-off.

## ADR-0001 — separate backend repo, not a monorepo

**Status:** accepted (2026-07-22)

**Decision:** the arena backend is its own repo, `agents-arena-backend`, under BuidlGuidl. damu and pablo build the frontend in their own fork of the ai-ctf repo. no shared monorepo for v1.

**Why:** the frontend team is already forking ai-ctf; forcing a monorepo now would couple two teams' deploy cycles for no v1 payoff. a monorepo may come later.

**Trade-off:** the API contract can't be a shared workspace package. it becomes a first-class deliverable — checked-in `API.md` + `arena-types.ts` the frontend copies (ADR-0002).

**Consequence:** the repo ships a small mock React frontend of its own, so the backend team can exercise the full vertical slice (SSE → browser) without waiting on the real frontend.

## ADR-0002 — API contract travels as checked-in files, not a package

**Status:** accepted (2026-07-22)

**Decision:** the contract is `API.md` (endpoints, auth, SSE semantics) plus one `arena-types.ts` (the `ArenaEvent` envelope, event payloads, run states, request/response types), checked into the backend repo. the frontend fork copies the types file.

**Why:** a published npm package means a publish cycle on every contract tweak during the phase the contract churns most. files cost nothing and freeze naturally.

**Trade-off:** the frontend re-copies on change. acceptable while the contract is small and changes rarely; graduate to `@buidlguidl/arena-types` once it survives the first real race.

## ADR-0003 — an entrant is a persistent steerable session, not a one-shot process

**Status:** accepted (2026-07-22) — supersedes an earlier one-shot-process model

**Decision:** each entrant runs one long-lived harness session that the arena injects turns into. Claude: `claude -p --input-format stream-json` held open (or `--resume`). Codex: `codex exec` then `codex exec resume <session-id>`. three turn sources share one injection mechanism: opening prompt, auto-nudge, Austin steer.

**Why:** steering is now a product goal — Austin intervenes live ("Codex, you're missing flag 7, keep going"). one-shot processes can't be steered, go silent when the model exits early (bad television), and lose the agent's memory of failed attempts across relaunches. a persistent session makes Austin-steer and auto-nudge the same code path.

**Trade-off:** the runner is more complex than spawn-and-forget, and it leans on each harness's session/stdin-injection support (verified present in both installed CLIs). the escape hatch, if stdio steering proves flaky in rehearsal, is the structured control plane (`codex app-server` JSON-RPC, Claude Agent SDK) — deferred, not adopted, because it costs the clean "both harnesses are line-buffered JSON on stdout" adapter symmetry.

**Consequence:** auto-nudge and Austin-steer are one endpoint family. nudge prompts are built from on-chain flag truth, never the agent's self-report.

## ADR-0004 — v1 transport is stdout JSON; hooks deferred

**Status:** accepted (2026-07-22)

**Decision:** v1 gets structured activity only from each harness's stdout JSON (Claude `stream-json`, Codex `--json`). agent hooks are deferred to a later iteration.

**Why:** stdout JSON already carries the whole public feed (messages, tool calls, results, usage) and a turn-end signal for idle detection. hooks add a second, harness-specific, CLI-version-fragile channel; not worth the adapter cost until the content path is proven.

**Trade-off:** the exciting "agent just broadcast a transaction" moment surfaces via the `FlagMinted` watcher (a few seconds late) rather than a `PreToolUse` hook firing the instant `cast send` runs. accepted for v1.

**When we revisit:** the headline reason to add hooks later is tx-interception (emit `arena.tx_submitted` before the chain confirms). secondary uses: a cleaner `Stop`-hook idle signal and a network guardrail. each hook stays tiny — write one JSON line to a fifo the runner reads — so the adapter still normalizes into one `ArenaEvent` stream.

**Consequence:** v1 idle detection reads the terminal result line in each harness's stdout stream, not a hook.

## ADR-0005 — fresh wallet + identity per entrant per run, gated on a balance-watch

**Status:** accepted (2026-07-22) — supersedes an earlier manual-fixture model

**Decision:** at `preparing`, the arena generates a fresh keypair per entrant. it does NOT hold a hot treasury key as a hard dependency. funding arrives one of two ways into the same gate:
- **live event:** the dashboard shows both addresses, Austin sends Base ETH from the BuidlGuidl treasury on stream.
- **rehearsal:** an optional operator treasury key auto-sends, so runs iterate without a human.

the run holds in a new `awaiting_funding` state until each entrant's balance crosses a threshold, then runs preflight (funded, flag #1 not yet minted) and moves to `ready`. the arena does NOT register the ERC-8004 identity — the agent does it itself in-race as its first action (see ADR-0006).

**Why:** flags can't be minted twice to one address, so every rehearsal needs a virgin wallet — manual fixtures don't survive the iteration count. generating per run makes every race repeatable. the balance-watch gate is where the "Austin funds live" product moment and the "don't start the timer until wallets are real" correctness gate become one mechanism.

**Trade-off:** adds one lifecycle state (`awaiting_funding`) and a chain-balance watcher to preflight. the arena depends on treasury ETH arriving; if Austin forgets to send, the run sits waiting (correct behavior, but needs a visible prompt on the dashboard).

**Consequence:** the run state machine is `created → preparing → awaiting_funding → ready → running → stopping → finished` (or `failed`).

## ADR-0006 — the agent self-registers its ERC-8004 identity; the backend never writes to a registry

**Status:** accepted (2026-07-22)

**Decision:** the arena does not register ERC-8004 identities. each agent registers its own identity on the real Base registry (`0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432`) as its first in-race action, then calls `Challenge1.registerAgent(agentId)` for flag #1. verified feasible: the registry sets `agentWallet = msg.sender`, so a wallet self-registers with the key it already holds.

**Why:** it removes registry-write logic and pre-registration gas timing from the backend, and it's more faithful to the test — deriving how to register from the live registry ABI is exactly the on-chain autonomy being measured, and it's watchable on stream. same task for both entrants, so fair.

**Trade-off:** registration is now a hard gate the agent can fumble — a failed registration means zero flags. mitigated by stating the entry sequence as an operational instruction in the prompt (not a puzzle hint), the same way flag #1 is stated as mandatory.

**Consequence:** preflight checks only funded + flag-#1-not-minted; there is no identity to verify at ready-time. scoring stays per-wallet-address (the arena never needs the agentId — it watches `FlagMinted` by the address it generated).

**Prompt posture (iterable, not carved):** silent on the 12 puzzles (discovery-based, keeps challenge 9's empty-ABI signal), explicit on operational mechanics (wallet + key location, Base RPC, the register→flag-#1 entry sequence, same-address rule, gas funded, helper contracts allowed). identical for both entrants bar a one-line per-harness tool note.

## ADR-0007 — dev substrate is the ai-ctf repo's own local chain, selected via a chain profile

**Status:** accepted (2026-07-22)

**Decision:** dev and early slices run against the ai-ctf repo's local Scaffold-ETH chain (`yarn chain` + `yarn deploy`), which deploys all 12 challenges, `NFTFlags`, and the `MockIdentityRegistry`. the arena selects a chain via a **chain profile**: `{ rpcUrl, chainId, nftFlags, challenge1, identityRegistry }`. local is one profile; real Base is another. only addresses + RPC change between them — runner, watcher, and adapters are identical.

**Why:** the target's own deploy scripts stand up the whole game for free, deterministically, resettably, maintained by the contract owners so local can't drift from theirs. real Base ETH and double-mint wallet burn stay out of the hundreds of dev runs. a fresh local deploy also has no shared-state interference (challenges 5/8/11), so early dev measures the agent in isolation.

**Trade-off:** the mock registry's `registerAgent(string domain)` signature differs from the real Base registry, so the agent's registration path in local dev is not byte-identical to production. closed in the dedicated real-Base rehearsal slice, which flips the chain profile. the profile switch is also the "clean benchmark vs live shared board" distinction — two different products.

**Consequence:** slices 1-7 need no mainnet dependency; slice 8 (rehearsal) flips to the Base profile to exercise the real registry signature, real `FlagMinted`, and gas.

## ADR-0008 — v1 entrant lineup is codex + opencode; claude-code deferred

**Status:** accepted (2026-07-22) — supersedes the claude-vs-codex lineup in the PRD and ADR-0003's claude examples

**Decision:** the two v1 entrants are Codex and OpenCode. the Claude Code adapter is deferred behind the same harness-adapter seam it was designed into. opencode runs via the OpenRouter api key (dev default deepseek; model pinned per preset, free `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free` available for cheap loops).

**Why:** running a claude subscription headless inside arena containers risks the account (team decision, 2026-07-22). codex and opencode both expose the same shape the ADRs already require: line-JSON stdout (`codex exec --json`, `opencode run --format json`) and session resume for turn injection (`codex exec resume <thread_id>`, `opencode run -s <sessionID>`). api-key-based opencode has no subscription-ToS exposure.

**Trade-off:** the marquee "claude vs codex" matchup becomes "codex vs opencode" until a sanctioned claude credential exists (org api key or explicit blessing). adapter symmetry is preserved, so claude is an adapter away.

**Consequence:** slice 2 = codex adapter, slice 3 = opencode adapter. the pinned image ships codex + opencode CLIs, no claude CLI. toolchain locked the same day: pnpm workspaces, tsx runtime, vitest.
